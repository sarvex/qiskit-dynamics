class InstructionToSignals:
    """Converts pulse instructions to signals to be used in models.

    The :class:`InstructionsToSignals` class converts a pulse schedule to a list of signals that can
    be given to a model. This conversion is done by calling the :meth:`get_signals` method on a
    schedule. The converter applies to instances of :class:`~qiskit.pulse.Schedule`. Instances of
    :class:`~qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock` must first be converted to :class:`~qiskit.pulse.Schedule`
    using the :func:`~qiskit.pulse.transforms.block_to_schedule` function in Qiskit Pulse.

    The converter can be initialized with the optional arguments ``carriers`` and ``channels``. When
    ``channels`` is given, only the signals specified by name in ``channels`` are returned. The
    ``carriers`` dictionary specifies the analog carrier frequency of each channel. Here, the keys
    are the channel name, e.g. ``d12`` for drive channel number ``12``, and the values are the
    corresponding frequency. If a channel is not present in ``carriers`` it is assumed that the
    analog carrier frequency is zero.

    See the :meth:`get_signals` method documentation for a detailed description of how pulse
    schedules are interpreted and translated into :class:`.DiscreteSignal` objects.

        r"""Convert a schedule to a corresponding list of DiscreteSignal instances.

        Which channels are converted, and the order they are returned, is controlled by the
        ``channels`` argument at instantiation. The ``carriers`` instantiation argument sets the
        analog carrier frequency for each channel, which is fixed for the full duration. For a given
        channel, the :math:`k^{th}` envelope sample for the corresponding :class:`.DiscreteSignal`
        is determined according to the following formula:

        .. math::
            f(k) \exp(i(2\pi \Delta\nu(k) k dt + \phi(k) + 2 \pi \phi_a(k))),

        where:

        * :math:`f(k)` is the waveform value at the :math:`k^{th}` time step as specified by
          ``Play`` instructions.
        * :math:`\Delta\nu(k)` is the frequency deviation at time step :math:`k` from the analog
          carrier as the result of ``SetFrequency`` and ``ShiftFrequency`` instructions. As evident
          by the formula, carrier frequency deviations as a result of these instructions are handled
          digitally, with the analog carrier frequency being fixed for the entirety of the schedule.
        * :math:`dt` is the sample rate as specified by the ``dt`` instantiation argument.
        * :math:`\phi(k)` is the channel phase at time step :math:`k`, as determined by
          ``ShiftPhase`` and ``SetPhase`` instructions.
        * :math:`\phi_a(k)` is the phase correction term at time step :math:`k`, impacted by
          ``SetFrequency`` and ``ShiftFrequency`` instructions, described below.

        In detail, the sample array for the output signal for each channel is generated by iterating
        over each instruction in the schedule in temporal order. New samples are appended with every
        ``Play`` instruction on the given channel, using the waveform values and the current value
        of the tracked parameters :math:`\Delta\nu`, :math:`\phi`, and :math:`\phi_a`, which are
        initialized to :math:`0`. Explicitly, each instruction is interpreted as follows:

        * ``Play`` instructions add new samples to the sample array, according to the above formula,
          using the waveform specified in the instruction and the current values of
          :math:`\Delta\nu`, :math:`\phi`, and :math:`\phi_a`.
        * ``ShiftPhase``, with a phase value :math:`\psi`, updates :math:`\phi \mapsto \phi + \psi`.
        * ``SetPhase``, with a phase value :math:`\psi`, updates :math:`\phi \mapsto \psi`.
        * ``ShiftFrequency``, with a frequency value :math:`\mu` at time-step :math:`k`, updates
          :math:`\phi_a \mapsto \phi_a - \mu k dt` and :math:`\Delta\nu \mapsto \Delta\nu + \mu`.
          The simultaneous shifting of both :math:`\Delta\nu` and :math:`\phi_a` ensures that the
          carrier wave, as a combination of the analog and digital components, is continuous across
          ``ShiftFrequency`` instructions (up to the sampling rate :math:`dt`).
        * ``SetFrequency``, with a frequency value :math:`\mu` at time-step :math:`k`, updates
          :math:`\phi_a \mapsto \phi_a - (\mu - (\Delta\nu + \nu)) k dt` and
          :math:`\Delta\nu \mapsto \mu - \nu`, where :math:`\nu` is the analog carrier frequency.
          Similarly to ``ShiftFrequency``, the shift rule for :math:`\phi_a` is defined to maintain
          carrier wave continuity.

        Args:
            schedule: The schedule to represent in terms of signals. Instances of
                :class:`~qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock` must first be converted to

                :func:`~qiskit.pulse.transforms.block_to_schedule` function in Qiskit Pulse.
