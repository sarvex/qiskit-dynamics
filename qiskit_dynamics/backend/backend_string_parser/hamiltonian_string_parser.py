def parse_backend_hamiltonian_dict(
    hamiltonian_dict: dict, subsystem_list: Optional[List[int]] = None
) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray, List[str], dict]:
    r"""Convert Pulse backend Hamiltonian dictionary into concrete array format
    with an ordered list of corresponding channels.

    The Pulse backend Hamiltonian dictionary, ``hamiltonian_dict``, must have the
    following keys:

    * ``'h_str'``: List of Hamiltonian terms in string format (see below).
    * ``'qub'``: Dictionary giving subsystem dimensions. Keys are subsystem labels,
      values are their dimensions.
    * ``'vars'``: Dictionary whose keys are the variables appearing in the terms in
      the ``h_str`` list, and values being the numerical values of the variables.

    The optional argument ``subsystem_list`` specifies a subset of subsystems to keep when parsing.
    If ``None``, all subsystems are kept. If ``subsystem_list`` is specified, then terms
    including subsystems not in the list will be ignored.

    Entries in the list ``hamiltonian_dict['h_str']`` must be formatted as a product of
    constants (either numerical constants or variables in ``hamiltonian_dict['vars'].keys()``)
    with operators. Operators are indicated with a capital letters followed by an integer
    indicating the subsystem the operator acts on. Accepted operator strings are:

    * ``'X'``: If the target subsystem is two dimensional, the
      Pauli :math:`X` operator, and if greater than two dimensional, returns
      :math:`a + a^\dagger`, where :math:`a` and :math:`a^\dagger` are the
      annihiliation and creation operators, respectively.
    * ``'Y'``: If the target subsystem is two dimensional, the
      Pauli :math:`Y` operator, and if greater than two dimensional, returns
      :math:`-i(a - a^\dagger)`, where :math:`a` and :math:`a^\dagger` are the
      annihiliation and creation operators, respectively.
    * ``'Z'``: If the target subsystem is two dimensional, the
      Pauli :math:`Z` operator, and if greater than two dimensional, returns
      :math:`I - 2 * N`, where :math:`N` is the number operator.
    * ``'a'``, ``'A'``, or ``'Sm'``: If two dimensional, the sigma minus operator, and if greater,
      generalizes to the operator.
    * ``'C'``, or ``'Sp'``: If two dimensional, sigma plus operator, and if greater,
      generalizes to the creation operator.
    * ``'N'``, or ``'O'``: The number operator.
    * ``'I'``: The identity operator.

    In addition to the above, a term in ``hamiltonian_dict['h_str']`` can be associated with
    a channel by ending it with a string of the form ``'||Sxx'``, where ``S`` is a valid channel
    label, and ``'xx'`` is an integer. Accepted channel labels are:

    * ``'D'`` or ``'d'`` for drive channels.
    * ``'U'`` or ``'u'`` for control channels.
    * ``'M'`` or ``'m'`` for measurement channels.
    * ``'A'`` or ``'a'`` for acquire channels.

    Finally, summations of terms of the above form can be indicated in
    ``hamiltonian_dict['h_str']`` via strings with syntax ``'_SUM[i, lb, ub, aa||S{i}]'``,
    where:

    * ``i`` is the summation variable.
    * ``lb`` and ``ub`` are the summation endpoints (inclusive).
    * ``aa`` is a valid operator string, possibly including the string ``{i}`` to indicate
      operators acting on subsystem ``i``.
    * ``S{i}`` is the specification of a channel indexed by ``i``.


    For example, the following ``hamiltonian_dict`` specifies a single
    transmon with 4 levels:

    .. code-block:: python

        hamiltonian_dict = {
            "h_str": ["v*np.pi*O0", "alpha*np.pi*O0*O0", "r*np.pi*X0||D0"],
            "qub": {"0": 4},
            "vars": {"v": 2.1, "alpha": -0.33, "r": 0.02},
        }

    The following example specifies a two transmon system, with single system terms specified
    using the summation format:

    .. code-block:: python

        hamiltonian_dict = {
            "h_str": [
                "_SUM[i,0,1,wq{i}/2*(I{i}-Z{i})]",
                "_SUM[i,0,1,delta{i}/2*O{i}*O{i}]",
                "_SUM[i,0,1,-delta{i}/2*O{i}]",
                "_SUM[i,0,1,omegad{i}*X{i}||D{i}]",
                "jq0q1*Sp0*Sm1",
                "jq0q1*Sm0*Sp1",
                "omegad1*X0||U0",
                "omegad0*X1||U1"
            ],
            "qub": {"0": 4, "1": 4},
            "vars": {
                "delta0": -2.111793476400394,
                "delta1": -2.0894421352015744,
                "jq0q1": 0.010495754104003914,
                "omegad0": 0.9715458990879812,
                "omegad1": 0.9803812537440838,
                "wq0": 32.517894442809514,
                "wq1": 33.0948996120196,
            },
        }

    Args:
        hamiltonian_dict: Pulse backend Hamiltonian dictionary.
        subsystem_list: List of subsystems to include in the model. If ``None`` all are kept.

    Returns:
        Tuple: Model converted into concrete arrays - the static Hamiltonian,
        a list of Hamiltonians corresponding to different channels, a list of
        channel labels corresponding to the list of time-dependent Hamiltonians,
        and a dictionary with subsystem dimensions whose keys are the subsystem labels.
